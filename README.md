# Armor: GUI-based analytics tool for microbiology lab data

The program is being developed to help microbiologists who have little background in data analytics to make use of their data.

It is not designed to be a replacement of other tools such as Microsoft Excel but as a tool
with specific features that users can use with other tools.

Also, being developed in the academic institution, this program is also designed to serve as a learning platform for medical technology students to learn about drug sensitivity test and antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria from analyzing the data.

The first stage of the development will be focused on providing tools for analyzing results from drug sensitivity test,
which will allow microbiologists to deal with AMR bacteria (super bugs) more efficiently.

The program is currently being developed by a team of one person at the Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Thailand.
