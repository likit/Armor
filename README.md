# Armor: GUI-based analytics tool for microbiology lab data

The program is being developed to help microbiologists who have little background in data analytics to make use of their data.

The first stage of the development will be focused on providing tools for analyzing results from drug sensitivity test,
which will allow microbiologists to deal with antimicrobial resistant bacteria (super bugs) more effeciently.

The program is being developed at the Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Thailand.
